                <div class="parallax">
                <p class="type">California is the most populous state in the United States and the third most extensive by area. Located on the western (Pacific Ocean) coast of the U.S., California is bordered by Oregon to the north, Nevada, to the east and northeast, Arizona to the southeast and it shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California to the south. The state capital is Sacramento. Los Angeles is Californias most populous city, and the countrys second largest after New York City. The Greater Los Angeles Area and the San Francisco Bay Area are the nation second- and fifth-most populous urban regions, respectively. California also has the nations most populous county, Los Angeles County, and its largest county by area, San Bernardino County.
California diverse geography ranges from the Pacific Coast in the west to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in the east; and from the redwood–Douglas fir forests in the northwest to the Mojave Desert in the southeast. The Central Valley, a major agricultural area, dominates the state center. Though California is well-known for its warm Mediterranean climate, the large size of the state means it can vary from moist temperate rainforest in the north, to arid desert in the interior, as well as snowy alpine in the mountains.
What is now California was first settled by various Native American tribes before being explored by a number of European expeditions during the 16th and 17th centuries. The Spanish Empire then claimed it as part of Alta California in their New Spain colony. The area became a part of Mexico in 1821 following its successful war for independence, but was ceded to the United States in 1848 after the Mexican–American War. The western portion of Alta California then was organized as the State of California, and admitted as the 31st state on September 9, 1850. The California Gold Rush starting in 1848 led to dramatic social and demographic changes, with large-scale emigration from the east and abroad with an accompanying economic boom.</p>

                        <p>This is another great place if you're looking for some coastal photos. The best time to come and take photos here is right at sunset or when there are storm clouds in the sky. Having an interesting sky will be extremely important for these photos. The best way to get a sense of what else can be photographed in this area is to look on Google maps with photos enabled. There are a few that people have shared that are really cool.
                                Also – doing a Google Image search for this area will give you an idea of what other people have done.</p>

                        <h3>Lake Tahoe</h3>
                        <p>Lake Tahoe is such a stunning place. Year round there will certainly be a photo worth taking, as well as many outdoor activities that you can do. The water is amazingly clear in the summer as well as the winter. If you can handle the cold, there are some great winter photographs to be made that will be unlike anything you'll get in the summer.

While you are at Lake Tahoe, be sure to check out Bonsai Rock. There have been a lot of photos taken here (you can see several on Google Images ) but I would challenge you to take a photo that is unique and just a little bit different from all the others. I can't tell you what that is, but if you're creative… you'll find the answer.</p>
